An online tool built using Javascript and React on the Next.JS framework to provide USF students a way to plan their next semester

Submission for USF's [Hackabull 2023](https://hackabull-2023.devpost.com/) - all built within 24 hours

### Check out the Classabull [here!](http://classabull.vercel.app)

As it stands, USF's current scheduling and registration system is clunky, outdated, and even lacks the ability to plan your own schedule in any meaningful way. Students will be left to themselves to keep track of what classes they would like to add and to make sure they don't conflict with one another. 

Classabull is designed to be easy to use while still maintaining functionality over finding classes and designing your schedule. Data is presented in a much more readable, organized manner and a visual schedule allows you to see how your day will flow.

Most of the front end was developed by Patrick (Fudgeu), while the back end was implemented by Ian (Enginma)

The app's class selection is currently limited - as we (sadly) do not have any sort of API access to the university's scheduling system - but for the most part, many of the core Computer Science classes should be in there.

## Deploy locally

Deploying is easy. Clone the repo into it's own folder, and run the following command to install all packages required:
```
npm i
```
Once that has finished, you can start up the development server using:
```
npm run dev
```

You can then visit the app at http://localhost:3000

We hope to continue developing Classabull past it's original submission for Hackabull, as we believe we've built a strong foundation for the app and it can prove to be a valuable resource to the USF community.

Thanks for checking this out!
